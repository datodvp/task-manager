<div style="display:flex; align-items: center">

</div>

Task Manager is built on pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript. For bundler I used Vite.
There was not really a lot of styles so i put them in one file. structure is modular each class controlles each part of the app. </br>
There is starting point from main.js which starts instance of TaskManager class.

### How to run the app in development mode

1\. you need to clone repository from github:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/datodvp/task-manager.git
```

2\. Next step requires you to run npm install in order to install all the JS dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```


3\.Next you can run npm run dev, which compiles and hot-reloads for development

```sh
npm run dev
```
